        Hi there! I'm Anurag, a Software Engineer with a passion for Machine
        Learning. Based in India and with a dream to work abroad in countries
        like the USA or UK, I'm on a journey to make AI come alive. My expertise
        lies in developing cutting-edge solutions that harness the power of AI
        and ML to transform ideas into reality. When I'm not coding, you can
        find me playing chess, working out, binging YouTube, or diving deeper
        into the world of AI and computer science. Let's create the future
        together, one line of code at a time.
